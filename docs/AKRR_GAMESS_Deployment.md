# AKRR: Deployment of GAMESS-US Application Kernel on a Resource

[GAMESS](http://www.msg.chem.iastate.edu/gamess/) is an ab initio computational chemistry 
software package developed by Professor Mark Gordon's research group at Iowa State University.

GAMESS applications kernel can be used to 
monitory the performance of system-wide GAMESS installation. 

It is also linked against linear algebra library and can use file-system for cache storage. 
Thus it also can work as a probe to monitor performance of these items.

If there is nobody uses GAMESS on your site you can skip it. However, 
unlike benchmarks (HPCC, IOR, IMB) which stress a particular subsystem 
GAMESS application kernel works more like an integrated test and the affects on it can be much milder.


For further convenience of application kernel deployment lets define APPKER and RESOURCE environment 
variable which will contain the HPC resource name:

```bash
export RESOURCE=<resource_name>
export APPKER=gamess
```

# Install Application or Identify where it is Installed

GAMESS is very often installed system-wide. One of the purposes of application kernels is to monitor 
the performance of application which is used by regular users. If GAMESS is not installed then you 
might need to install this application on your resource or opt to not use it.

Majority of HPC resources utilize some kind of module system. Execute it and see is GAMESS already 
installed

**On resource**
```bash
module avail gamess
```
```text
------------------------- /util/academic/modulefiles/Core ------------------------------------
   gamess/5dec2014R1-ddi    gamess/5dec2014R1    gamess/11Nov2017R3    gamess/18Aug2016R1 (D)

```

We'll use gamess/11Nov2017R3. Running GAMESS is somewhat different from other application. We need to find
binary location and its version. `module show` whould have some information
```bash
module show gamess/11Nov2017R3
```
```text
whatis(" GAMESS")
prepend_path("PATH","/util/academic/gamess/11Nov2017R3/impi/gamess")
load("intel/18.1")
load("intel-mpi/2018.1")
load("mkl/2018.1")
```
By checking path prepended directory:
```bash
ls /util/academic/gamess/11Nov2017R3/impi/gamess
```
we can find executable is gamess.01.x and it lives in /util/academic/gamess/11Nov2017R3/impi/gamess and 
version number is 01 (whatever characters between dots in gamess.01.x).

GAMESS is started with rungms script and it needed to be changed almost always, usually for scratch locations. 
GAMESS stores there final results and in case of rerun (which is AKRR intention) it would not run.
 
Copy rungms to app kernel directory on remote resource:

```bash
# AKRR_APPKER_DIR should be initiated in .bashrc and placed there during initial deployment on resource
cd $AKRR_APPKER_DIR/execs
mkdir gamess
cd gamess
cp /util/academic/gamess/11Nov2017R3/impi/gamess/rungms ./
```

Set SCR and USERSCR to `pwd` in your copy of rungms (located in the begining of script):
```bash
set SCR=`pwd`
set USERSCR=`pwd`
```
AKRR starts GAMESS from temporary directory and it is deleted after downloading results.

# Generate Initiate Configuration File

Generate Initiate Configuration File:

**On AKRR server**
```bash
akrr app add -a $APPKER -r $RESOURCE
```
Sample output:
```text
[INFO] Generating application kernel configuration for gamess on ub-hpc
[INFO] Application kernel configuration for gamess on ub-hpc is in: 
        /home/akrruser/akrr/etc/resources/ub-hpc/gamess.app.conf
```

# Edit Configuration File

Below is listing of example configuration file located at ~/akrr/etc/resources/$RESOURCE/gamess.app.conf

**~/akrr/etc/resources/$RESOURCE/gamess.app.conf**
```python
appkernel_run_env_template = """
# Load application enviroment
module load gamess
module list

# set executable location
VERNO=01
EXE=$GAMESS_DIR/gamess.$VERNO.x

# set how to run app kernel
RUN_APPKERNEL="$AKRR_APPKER_DIR/execs/gamess/rungms $INPUT $VERNO $AKRR_CORES"
"""
```

It contain only one parameter _appkernel_run_env_template_ which need to be edited:

1) First part is "Load application environment", here you need to set proper enviroment. For example:

```bash
# Load application environment
module load gamess/11Nov2017R3
module list
```

2) Second part is "set executable location", it set the location of executables absolute path to 
gamess should be placed to EXE variable (application signature will be calculated for that 
executable) as well as version (VERNO). Use values which we find earlier. For example:

```bash
# set executable location
VERNO=01
EXE=/util/academic/gamess/11Nov2017R3/impi/gamess/gamess.$VERNO.x
```

3)Fourth part is "set how to run app kernel", it set RUN_APPKERNEL, which specify how to execute GAMESS:
```bash
#Set how to ran app kernel
RUN_APPKERNEL="$AKRR_APPKER_DIR/execs/gamess/rungms $INPUT $VERNO $AKRR_NODES $AKRR_CORES_PER_NODE"
```
Most likely you don't need to modify anything here, just ensure that `rungms` refer to your 
version which was modified earlied..


# Generate Batch Job Script and Execute it Manually (Optional) 


The purpose of this step is to ensure that the configuration lead to correct workable batch job 
script. Here, at first batch job script is generated with 'akrr_ctl.sh batch_job'. Then this script 
is executed in interactive session (this improves the turn-around in case of errors). If script 
fails to execute, the issues can be fixed first in that script itself and then merged to 
configuration file.

This step is somewhat optional because it is very similar to next step. However the opportunity to 
work in interactive session improve turn-around time because there is no need to stay in queue for 
each iteration.

First generate the script to standard output and examine it:

```bash
akrr task new --dry-run --gen-batch-job-only -n 2 -r $RESOURCE -a $APPKER
```

Next generate the script on resource:

```bash
akrr task new --gen-batch-job-only -n 2 -r $RESOURCE -a $APPKER
```
```text

```

The output contains the working directory for this task on remote resource. On remote resource get 
to that directory and start interactive session (request same number of nodes, in example above the 
script was generated for 2 nodes).

**On remote resource**
```bash
#get to working directory
cd /projects/ccrstaff/general/nikolays/huey/akrr_data/gamess/2019.04.29.20.04.39.697226
#check hpcc.job is there
ls
#start interactive session
salloc --nodes=2 --ntasks-per-node=8 --time=01:00:00 --exclusive --constraint="CPU-L5520"
#wait till you get access to interactive session
#run ior application kernel
bash gamess.job

# or submit as normal batch script
sbatch gamess.job

#examine output
cat appstdout
```

Examine appstdout file, which contains application kernel output ([appstdout sample](AKRR_GAMESS_appsout_sample.md)). 
If it looks ok you can move to the next step

# Perform Validation Run

On this step appkernel_validation.py utility is used to validate application kernel installation on 
particular resource. It execute application kernel and analyses its' results. If it fails the 
problems need to be fixed and another round of validation should be performed.

```bash
akrr app validate -n 2 -r $RESOURCE -a $APPKER 
```

See [validation output sample](AKRR_GAMESS_appkernel_validation_sample.md)

# Schedule regular execution of application kernel.

Now this application kernel can be submitted for regular execution:

# Perform a test run on all nodes count
```bash
#Perform a test run on all nodes count
akrr task new -r $RESOURCE -a $APPKER -n 1,2,4,8

#Start daily execution from today on nodes 1,2,4,8 and distribute execution time between 1:00 and 5:00
akrr task new -r $RESOURCE -a $APPKER -n 1,2,4,8 -t0 "01:00" -t1 "05:00" -p 1

# Run on all nodes count 20 times (default number of runs to establish baseline)
akrr task new -r $RESOURCE -a $APPKER -n 1,2,4,8 --n-runs 20
```
