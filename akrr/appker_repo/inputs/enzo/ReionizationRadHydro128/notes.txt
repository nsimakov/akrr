This test is based on ReionizationRadHydro.
TopGrid was increased to 128^3
CosmologyComovingBoxSize was increased to 20.0 
InlineHaloFinder was disabled as it do seg.fault on large core counts



This is a cosmology simulation that simulates reionization using the 
ray tracing radiation transfer method with radiating star particles
and a Haardt & Madau background.  It will run on 2 processors in about
40 minutes.

Usage:
./inits.exe -d ReionizationRadHydro.inits
mpirun -np 2 ./ring.exe pv ParticlePositions ParticleVelocities
mpirun -np 2 ./enzo.exe -d ReionizationRadHydro.enzo

simulating the formation of the first galaxies and reionizationâ€”the process by which
neutral hydrogen atoms in space were transformed into positively charged, or
ionized, hydrogen, allowing light to spread throughout the universe.

The simulated period, known as the epoch of reionization, took place some 13 billion
years ago and was challenging to reconstruct, as it involves immensely complicated,
chaotic interactions, including those between gravity, gas and radiation, or light.
